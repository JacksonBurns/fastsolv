# `fastsolv` Monorepo
This repository contains the code for the following three items:
 - `fastsolv`: the `fastsolv` python package which allows using the trained `fastsolv` model for solid solubility prediction.
 - `fastsolv_web`: the `fastsolv_web` python package which serves a web-based version of the `fastsolv` predictor, one instance of which is hosted at [fastsolv.mit.edu](https://fastsolv.mit.edu/).
 - `paper`: the original development code and models used for training the `fastsolv` model, as described in 'Solid Solubility Prediction at the Limit of Aleatoric Uncertainty' by Attia, Burns, Doyle, and Green.
